    <h2>About Page</h2>
    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in
                exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA
                2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his
                shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which remained with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin.
            
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.
            
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
            
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
                said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
                when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger
                brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and
                Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
            
                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered
                Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was
                captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a
                fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

            <p>
                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In
                the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the
                other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other
                Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of
                Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

                shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in
                the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

                his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven
                out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf
                warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he
                continued his life as a toy maker.

            <h3>Bombur</h3>
            <p>
                Bombur was a Dwarf who accompanied Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins on their quest to the Lonely Mountain as
                part of the company, alongside his brother Bofur and cousin Bifur. Bombur was noted as the fattest Dwarf in the
                company.
            
                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line,
                although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
                between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years,"
                and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA
                2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the
                Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>
                Gandalf, known temporarily as the Grey and later the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya), was an Istar
                (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin II
                Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to
                destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
            
                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music
                of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he became
                one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like
                Varda, yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but
                walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them
                wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of
                Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.
